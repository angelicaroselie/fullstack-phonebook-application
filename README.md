# Fullstack Phonebook Application #

# What?

This boilerplate contains `React`, `express`, the required dependencies and a small amount of useful ones.

The folder structure is as follows:

frontend / client

backend / server


## root files ##


#### index.html ####

This is the template that will be turned to the html loaded by the browser first. You can throw in whatever you want, like google analytics scripts or meta tags such as this mobile friendly one:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

#### index.js ####

This is the entrypoint when starting the application.
